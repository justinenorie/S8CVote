# üó≥Ô∏è S8CVote: Voting Management System

**S8CVote** is a cross-platform Voting Management System developed as a capstone project for **Southville 8C National High School**. It focuses on administrators to organize elections, manage candidates, and tally results, while allowing the students to vote securely from web and mobile platforms ‚Äî both online and offline.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

S8CVote aims to modernize and streamline the election process within the school environment. The system supports real-time vote monitoring, offline mobile voting (room-to-room), secure authentication, and automated tallying with instant result generation.

## üîí Security Practices

Security is a core focus of S8CVote, especially due to the sensitivity of voting data. The system includes the following mechanisms and protocols:

---

### ‚úÖ User Authentication & Authorization

- **Secure Login:** Role-based authentication with secure credential storage
- **Password Hashing:** All passwords are hashed using `bcryptjs` before being stored in the database
- **JWT Tokens:** Stateless session management using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for access and refresh tokens
- **Cookie-based Sessions:** Secure HTTP-only cookies for storing authentication tokens when needed
- **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):** Optional second layer of login verification for admin accounts (e.g., password + code)

---

### ‚úÖ Voter Integrity & Validation

- **Voter Validation:** Verifies voter identity using Student ID + Full Name combination
- **Voter Qualification Rules:**
  - Student must exist in the uploaded records
  - Student must not have already voted
  - If validation passes, only then is voting allowed
- **Prevention of Duplicate Voting:** Once a vote is cast, the system flags the student as "voted" in the database
- **Vote Sync Auditing:** Offline votes are timestamped and validated before being committed to the online database

---

### ‚úÖ Data Security

- **2-Level Encryption:**
  - ‚úÖ **At Rest:** Data stored in the database (e.g., vote records) may be encrypted using algorithms like AES-256
  - ‚úÖ **In Transit:** All network communication is encrypted using HTTPS (SSL/TLS)
- **AES-256 Encryption:** Industry-standard symmetric encryption used for securing sensitive offline vote data or local backups
- **Tokenization:** Sensitive identifiers (e.g., student records) can be tokenized to replace raw data with unique, non-sensitive tokens
- **Input Sanitization:** All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (SQLi, XSS)
- **CORS Headers & CSRF Protections:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is properly configured; CSRF protection added for web forms

---

### ‚úÖ System Architecture

- **Application Isolation:** The backend, web frontend, desktop app, and mobile app are separated into modules. Each platform authenticates independently and interacts only through secure API endpoints.
- **Cross-Platform Security Consistency:** All platforms (web, desktop, mobile) use the same security principles: token-based auth, secure storage, encrypted transport, and role-based access

---

### ‚úÖ Monitoring & Logs

- **Access Logs:** All requests logged via `Morgan`, with timestamps, routes, and user actions
- **Failed Login Monitoring:** Repeated failed attempts are tracked and can be locked or throttled
- **Audit Trails:** Admin actions (e.g., create/delete election) are logged for transparency
